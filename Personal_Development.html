		<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
		<p>I belive one of my strentgh is the determination I have when I'm doing a task I don't just quit when things get too hard<p>
		<p>Another strength I have is the amount of energy I have when doing thing,I belive when your doing something you do it your best and nothing less</p>
		<p>lastly I dont believe in doubting myself with whatever it is I'm doing because if I do what is the point of doing it.</p>
		<p><b>How have I been developing myself over the pass few years.</b></p>
		<p>As a man in his early 20s I’m not sure what to expect from life.</p>
		<p>However my vision is that I will achieve a lot of success in what ever it is I put my mind to as long as I stay focused,</p>
		<p>determined and confident in what ever I’m doing.</p>
		<p><b>Thoughts on Chapters 4–7 of Twelve Pillars</b><br>
		After reading the Twelve Pillars I realized that there were a lot of little changes I could make in my life to better myself.<br> The first is writing down my goals,<br> this is something I didn't think was very important until I read the book.<br> Writing down goals would always remind me why I'm working towards what I'm working towards.<br> Another change is the mindset of achieving your goals for what it will turn you into,<br> I will admit I always look at the result more than I look at the process but after reading I realized this needed to change If I was to get ahead in life.<br> Planning is also a thing I need to work on because normally my plans are not well thought out because I always rush things.<br> I think one of my biggest problems is procrastination because I always tend to delay the work I'm given and always miss the due date<br>. Another big issue is my reading as a child I always hated reading and this has always been a huge problem in my life,<br> especially in school an example of this is when I can hardly understand the question or assignments I'm given. Lastly I could surround myself with better people,<br> who can either help or push me to do better things.
